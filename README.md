# Pheo

Pheo is a desktop and web music player application built on top of NodeJS and Angular, atom-shell and other web technologies. It will do the following, and hopefully more:

- help you organise your library in an opinionated, but customisable way
- remind you about music you have in your library, but have never listened to
- create rules to automatically sort new music right when you import it (e.g. "if title contains 'Mix' and length >= 15min then add to category 'Mixes'")
- nag you about audio files that lack basic tags (fix them!), or can not be tagged well (WAVs - convert them!)
- Look like a modern webapp (it will lean towards Google's new design spec at http://www.google.com/design/), but not require full screen at all
- be customisable in its look to some degree (color schemes!)
- Play back "It's Album Time" by Todd Terje (if you have it. If you don't, this problem will be easily fixable by buying the album)
